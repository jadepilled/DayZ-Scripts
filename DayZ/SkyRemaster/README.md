# Sky Remaster

Sky Remaster replaces the vanilla sky dome color texture with a custom image-based texture so modders can ship a detailed sky panorama. The mod patches `CfgWorlds` for CAWorld derivatives (e.g. Chernarus and Livonia) and points the `skyTexture/skyTextureR` entries at `SkyRemaster/data/tex/sky_co.paa`.

Add your final `.paa` sky texture to `SkyRemaster/data/tex/sky_co.paa` before packaging the mod. The placeholder file included here is only to preserve the expected path in source control.
